[Link to live site](https://hebaulf.github.io/myPortfolio/) 

This is my portfolio as a first project in Vefsk√≥li.
In this project I used node-sass for cleaner css and compile to .css file.

### Project contains:
- <header> element, <main> element and <footer> element with contact info (header does not contain a logo whereas it did not fit the project)
- Section, Paragraphs, list, image and anchor elements
- Use of color palette
- Use of Google fonts (or similar)
- Hover state for links
- Use BEM notation for the CSS


## Running the project
Clone project and remember to run `npm install` first.

Run `npm run sass` to compile Sass to .css while working on project
